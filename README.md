## What is this?
A basic Vanilla Javascript drum kit that allows you to use your keyboard to play sounds like a drum kit. 

## Why am I doing this?
Recognizing the need to enhance my project experience repository, I made the strategic decision to initiate a series aimed at augmenting my proficiency. Specifically, I opted to commence with a curated series that offers instruction on crafting 30 Vanilla JavaScript projects within a 30-day timeframe. This deliberate choice was motivated by a desire to challenge and further develop my skill set in a structured and systematic manner.

## Caveats
I understand there may be concerns regarding the authenticity and integrity of this project, particularly regarding my level of involvement and effort. Allow me to address any doubts by affirming my commitment to engaging fully with the tutorial material, independently crafting the code, and abstaining from mere copying and pasting. It's worth noting that you may observe multiple iterations of index.html files or final result files labeled differently. These variations represent my deliberate attempts to challenge myself by recreating the code without reliance on external references.
