A basic Vanilla Javascript drum kit that allows you to use your keyboard to play sounds like a drum kit. 

## Why am I doing this?
Recognizing the need to enhance my project experience repository, I made the strategic decision to initiate a series aimed at augmenting my proficiency. Specifically, I opted to commence with a curated series that offers instruction on crafting 30 Vanilla JavaScript projects within a 30-day timeframe. This deliberate choice was motivated by a desire to challenge and further develop my skill set in a structured and systematic manner.
